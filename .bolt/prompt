For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

## Keeping It Simple for the User

- **User Interaction**: The user still types a query and sees search results or a generated article, much like perplexity.  
- **Insights**: Partial updates (“Searching…,” “Summarizing…,” “Drafting…”) are shown in the UI, enhancing transparency).

1. User Types
Guest – Visitors who haven’t registered or logged in.
Normal – Logged-in users on the free tier.
Premium – Logged-in users on the paid (subscriber) tier.
This way, “Premium” clearly indicates the user is subscribed, avoiding confusion with any “Pro” references.

2. Subscription Tiers
Free Tier – Available for Normal users.
Paid Tier (or “Pro Tier” to keep some “Pro” branding) – For Premium users.
You can call your paid tier “Premium” —just make sure it aligns with your user naming. For instance, Premium user on the Premium (Paid) tier.

3. Search Levels
Basic Search – Included for Guest or Standard users.
Advanced Pro Search – An Advanced or “Pro” search for Premium users.
