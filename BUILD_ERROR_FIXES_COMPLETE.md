# Build Error Fixes - COMPLETE

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Entry Module Error
**Error:** `Could not resolve entry module "./src/services/research/pro/pages/ResearcherResults.tsx"`

**Root Cause:** The vite.config.ts was referencing a non-existent file path in the manual chunks configuration.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
'./src/services/research/pro/pages/ResearcherResults.tsx'

// After (correct):
'./src/services/research/pro/pages/ResearchResults.tsx'
```

**Location:** `/Users/marcelo/Documents/Curios/vite.config.ts` line ~108

### 2. useLocation Import Issues
**Error:** `Module '"react-router-dom"' has no exported member 'useLocation'`

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent import patterns between different router packages.

**Fix Applied:**
- ProSearchResults.tsx: Changed from `react-router-dom` to `react-router`
- SearchResults.tsx: Already using correct `react-router` import

## Changes Made

### vite.config.ts
```diff
'components-results': [
  './src/services/lab/regular/pages/LabsResults.tsx',
- './src/services/research/pro/pages/ResearcherResults.tsx',
+ './src/services/research/pro/pages/ResearchResults.tsx',
  './src/services/search/pro/pages/ProSearchResults.tsx',
  './src/services/research/regular/pages/InsightsResults.tsx'
],
```

### Import Consistency
All React Router imports now use `react-router` instead of `react-router-dom` for consistency:
- ✅ ProSearchResults.tsx
- ✅ SearchResults.tsx
- ✅ All other route components

## Validation
- ✅ No compilation errors in vite.config.ts
- ✅ No compilation errors in SearchResults.tsx
- ✅ No compilation errors in ProSearchResults.tsx
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ dist/ folder contains all required assets

## Status
**RESOLVED** - All build errors have been fixed and the project now builds successfully.

The issues were caused by:
1. Incorrect file path reference in vite build configuration
2. Import inconsistencies between router packages

Both issues have been resolved with targeted fixes that maintain all existing functionality while ensuring clean builds.
