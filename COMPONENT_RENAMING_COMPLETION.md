# Component Renaming Completion Summary

## Task Completed Successfully ✅

The component renaming from `SearchContainer` to `InputContainer` has been completed successfully. All references have been updated and the application builds without errors.

## Files Status:

### ✅ **Successfully Renamed:**
- `src/components/search/SearchContainer.tsx` → `src/components/search/InputContainer.tsx`
- Component function: `SearchContainer()` → `InputContainer()`

### ✅ **Updated Import References:**
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - ✅ Already updated to import `InputContainer`
- `src/components/Home.tsx` - ✅ Already updated to import `InputContainer`

### ✅ **Updated Component Usage:**
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - ✅ Using `<InputContainer />`
- `src/components/Home.tsx` - ✅ Using `<InputContainer />`

### ✅ **Build Status:**
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSED
- Vite build process: ✅ PASSED  
- No compilation errors or warnings related to the renaming

## Current Component Architecture:

```
InputContainer (src/components/search/InputContainer.tsx)
  └── ThreeSelector (src/components/search/ThreeSelector.tsx)
      ├── FunctionSelector (src/components/SearchInput/FunctionSelector.tsx)
      └── FunctionTooltip (src/components/SearchInput/FunctionTooltip.tsx)
```

## What This Achieves:

1. **Better Naming Convention**: `InputContainer` more accurately describes the component's role as a container for the search input interface, rather than the more generic `SearchContainer`

2. **Cleaner Architecture**: The rename aligns with the component's actual functionality - it contains the input interface with the three-selector UI

3. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact, only the internal component naming has been improved

## Next Steps:

The three-selector UI is now fully implemented and ready for testing:
- Guest users can access basic functions (Search, Insights, Labs)
- Signed users can access both basic and Pro functions
- Sign Up Modal appears when guests try to access Pro functions
- Moving indicator follows selections
- Fixed tooltips display function information

The application is ready for live browser testing to verify the complete user experience.
