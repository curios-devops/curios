# MEMORY LEAK DEBUGGING - TIMEOUT FIX

## CRITICAL MEMORY LEAK IDENTIFIED

**Issue**: The `setTimeout` in SearchRetrieverAgent's timeout promises are never cleared, causing:
1. **Memory accumulation** - Each search creates timeouts that remain in memory
2. **151MB memory usage** - Excessive for a search application  
3. **Application freeze** - Memory pressure causes black screen and frozen UI
4. **Perpetual timeout warnings** - "Brave search timeout triggered" keeps appearing

## ROOT CAUSE

In SearchRetrieverAgent:
```typescript
const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {  // ❌ This timeout is NEVER cleared
    logger.warn('Brave search timeout triggered', { timeout: API_TIMEOUTS.BRAVE });
    reject(new Error('Brave search timeout'));
  }, API_TIMEOUTS.BRAVE);
});
```

**Problem**: When Brave search completes successfully before timeout, the `setTimeout` continues running and holds memory.

## TEMPORARY FIX APPLIED

1. **Reduced logging frequency** in SearchResults component to prevent log accumulation
2. **Added debouncing** to meta tag updates to reduce DOM manipulation
3. **SearchRetrieverAgent timeout cleanup** - NEEDS TO BE RESTORED

## NEXT STEPS

1. Restore SearchRetrieverAgent with proper timeout cleanup
2. Test memory usage and application stability
3. Verify no more frozen states occur

## MEMORY LEAK SOURCES IDENTIFIED

1. ✅ **Timeout promises** - Primary cause (being fixed)
2. ✅ **Excessive logging** - Fixed with conditional logging  
3. ✅ **Meta tag DOM updates** - Fixed with debouncing
4. ✅ **Component re-renders** - Fixed with mount state tracking

The timeout cleanup is the critical fix needed to resolve the 151MB memory usage and application freeze.
