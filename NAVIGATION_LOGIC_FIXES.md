# 🔧 Navigation Logic Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ **Pro Search Routing Issue**
**Problem:** Pro Search was routing to `/search` instead of `/pro-search`
**Location:** `SimplifiedSearch.tsx` - `getFunctionRoute()` function
**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Both search and pro-search went to /search
case 'search':
case 'pro-search':
  return '/search';

// AFTER: Separate routes for each
case 'search':
  return '/search';
case 'pro-search':
  return '/pro-search';
```

### 2. ✅ **Guest User Settings Redirect Issue**
**Problem:** Guest users clicking "Insights" were redirected to `/settings`
**Root Cause:** Legacy code in `RegularSearch.tsx` with problematic logic
**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Redirected guests to settings
if (actualUserType === 'guest' && (tab === 'insights' || tab === 'labs')) {
  navigate('/settings');
  return;
}

// AFTER: Removed redirect logic - all users can select basic functions
// Removed legacy redirect logic - all users can now select any basic function
setActiveTab(tab);
```

## ✅ **Updated Navigation Behavior:**

### 👤 **Guest Users:**
- ✅ **CAN** click and select: Search, Insights, Labs (no more settings redirect)
- ✅ **Basic Search** → Routes to `/search`
- ✅ **Basic Insights** → Routes to `/insights-results` 
- ✅ **Basic Labs** → Routes to `/labs` (coming soon)
- ❌ **Pro functions** → Show Sign Up Modal (correct behavior)

### 👤 **Standard Users:**
- ✅ **Basic Search** → Routes to `/search`
- ✅ **Pro Search** → Routes to `/pro-search` 
- ✅ **Basic Insights** → Routes to `/insights-results`
- ✅ **Research** → Routes to `/insights-results` 
- ✅ **Basic Labs** → Routes to `/labs` (coming soon)
- ✅ **Pro Labs** → Routes to `/labs` (coming soon)

### 👤 **Premium Users:**
- ✅ **All functions work correctly** with proper routing

## What Was Fixed:
1. **Pro Search now properly routes to `/pro-search` instead of `/search`**
2. **Guest users can now select Insights without being redirected to settings**
3. **Removed legacy navigation logic that was causing conflicts**
4. **All user types now have correct function selection and routing behavior**

## Testing Required:
- ✅ Test guest user clicking "Insights" (should select function, not redirect)
- ✅ Test pro search routing (should go to `/pro-search`)
- ✅ Test insights routing (should go to `/insights-results`)
- ✅ Test that Sign Up Modal still appears when guests try Pro toggle
