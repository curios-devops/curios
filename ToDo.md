answer your last question : 

I do not see you DON'T see üü¢. I see initial vite violations : [Violation] 'message' handler took 258ms
inner.html:1 [Violation] 'load' handler took 158ms
out-4.5.45.js:1 [Violation] 'setTimeout' handler took 50ms
logger.ts:95 ; those are last messages I see on console : "üîç [WRITER] Article generation completed!
searchService.ts:169 üîç [SEARCH] SearchWriterAgent execution completed
searchService.ts:179 üîç [DEBUG] SearchWriterAgent response: {success: true, hasData: true, contentLength: 3153, followUpQuestionsCount: 5, citationsCount: 7,¬†‚Ä¶}
searchService.ts:188 üîç [SEARCH] SearchWriterAgent response: {success: true, hasData: true, contentLength: 3153, timestamp: '2025-10-03T06:09:13.599Z'}"; 

what I wory most is I do not see Brave responses. 
I think we are overcomplicated things. So lets do this to do list:

1. we need to validate  why we have 3 brave files:
brave.ts in common/tools
brave.ts in commonService/searchTools
braveSearchTools in commonService/searchTools

2. Retrofit swarm to have commonService or common but no both is confusing

3. Retrofit Brave to unify in one braveSearchTool file so merge the other two fies here

4. Validate (maybe with a partila write in the console) that  we are getting the full answer not just a 200 success with empty results, also double check for image results and decide  if you will be getting the images using the DeepResult
Aggregated deep results from images.

[Field	Type	Required	Description
news	list [ NewsResult ]	false	
A list of news results associated with the result.

videos	list [ VideoResult ]	false	
Videos associated with the result.

images	list [ Image ]	false	
Images associated with the result.]
or as a plan B , get images using the  Brave Image Search API that is currently available at the following endpoint and exposes an API to get images from the web relevant to the query.

https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/images/search
th

5. review agian the swarm to be sure is simple and robuts and handel well problems with brave result 
exist and are not empty and include images and is in the format agent writer is expecting unify and validate the right format for the agent writer [like validate the response structure is data.results.web NOT data.data.web! The edge function returns results as a direct property, not nested under data.]
