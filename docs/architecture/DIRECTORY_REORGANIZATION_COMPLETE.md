# Directory Reorganization Complete

## Summary
Successfully reorganized the project directory structure to improve clarity and maintainability by renaming the common directories to `commonApp` and `commonService`.

## Changes Made

### New Directory Structure
```
src/
├── commonApp/              # Application-wide shared resources
│   ├── auth/              # Authentication services (7 files)
│   ├── components/        # Shared UI components (3 files)  
│   ├── functions/         # Netlify functions (11 files)
│   ├── stripe/            # Payment integration (4 files)
│   └── types/             # Shared type definitions (2 files)
├── commonService/         # Service-specific shared resources
│   ├── agents/            # Base agent class (1 file)
│   ├── openai/            # OpenAI integration services (5 files)
│   ├── searchTools/       # Search tool integrations (6 files)
│   └── utils/             # Service utilities (7 files)
└── services/              # Domain-specific services
    ├── lab/               # Lab service
    ├── research/          # Research service
    └── search/            # Search service
```

### Files Moved

**To `src/commonApp/`:**
- All files from `src/common/auth/`
- All files from `src/common/components/`
- All files from `src/common/functions/`
- All files from `src/common/stripe/`
- All files from `src/common/types/`

**To `src/commonService/`:**
- All files from `src/services/common/openai/`
- All files from `src/services/common/searchTools/`
- All files from `src/services/common/utils/`
- `baseAgent.ts` from `src/common/agents/`

### Import Path Updates

Updated import paths throughout the codebase to use the new directory structure:

**Application-wide imports** (30+ files updated):
- `../common/types/` → `../commonApp/types/`
- `../common/auth/` → `../commonApp/auth/`

**Service-specific imports** (15+ files updated):
- `../services/common/openai/` → `../commonService/openai/`
- `../services/common/searchTools/` → `../commonService/searchTools/`
- `../services/common/utils/` → `../commonService/utils/`
- `../common/agents/baseAgent` → `../commonService/agents/baseAgent`

### Directories Removed
- `src/common/` (old application-wide common directory)
- `src/services/common/` (old service-specific common directory)

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: 
   - `commonApp` contains truly application-wide shared resources
   - `commonService` contains service-specific shared resources

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Clearer naming makes it easier to understand what belongs where
   - Eliminates confusion between different types of "common" resources

3. **Better Architecture**:
   - Aligns with the service-first architecture pattern
   - Maintains clean separation between app-level and service-level concerns

4. **Future-Proof**:
   - Easier to add new services without confusion about shared resources
   - Clear guidelines for where to place new common functionality

## Validation

- ✅ All files successfully moved to new locations
- ✅ All import paths updated throughout codebase
- ✅ Old directories cleaned up
- ✅ Project structure follows memory guidelines
- ✅ Maintains TypeScript type safety and extensionless import convention

The reorganization is complete and the codebase is ready for continued development with the improved structure.
