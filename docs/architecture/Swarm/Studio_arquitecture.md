# CuriosAI Studio – Social-First Video Explainer

## Overview

Studio is a new core functionality of CuriosAI designed to transform everyday curiosity-driven questions into short, social-first video explainers that are immediately shareable on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

Studio replaces the current "Labs" experience as the primary creative surface, while keeping the Labs directory intact for backward compatibility.

CuriosAI positioning:

* Similar to Perplexity in interaction (question → answer)
* Different in intent: curiosity, surprise, everyday learning
* Target user: casual, non-researcher, social-native user

---

## Core Principles

1. Social-first, not document-first
2. Low friction from question to share
3. Optimized for curiosity, not depth
4. Output should trigger surprise or delight
5. Sharing is the primary success metric

---

## Primary Output

A short explainer video generated from a user question.

Video characteristics:

* Duration: 10–60 seconds
* Formats:

  * Vertical (9:16) for mobile and social platforms
  * Horizontal (16:9) for desktop preview
* Includes:

  * Clear hook in first 2–3 seconds
  * Visual structure (scenes)
  * On-screen captions (burned-in)
  * Simple visual elements (text, stock video, subtle motion)
* Tone:

  * Clear
  * Conversational
  * Non-academic
  * Curiosity-driven

Example:

Question:
"Why do airplane windows have that tiny hole?"

Studio Output:

* 30-second vertical video
* Hook-driven intro
* Simple explanation with visuals
* Captions enabled
* Ready to share

---

## User Flow (Regular Tier)

1. User enters Studio from main navigation
2. User inputs a natural language question
3. System defaults to:

   * Video length: adaptive (10–60s)
   * Tone: curious, friendly
4. System generates:

   * Structured script
   * Scene breakdown
   * Captions
5. Video is rendered
6. User sees preview
7. User can:

   * Regenerate
   * Edit question
   * Download or copy share link
8. User is prompted to share on social platforms

---

## Sharing and Distribution

Required share targets:

* TikTok
* Instagram Reels
* YouTube Shorts

Sharing UX requirements:

* Clear share buttons
* Copy-ready caption text
* Auto-generated curiosity-optimized title

Sharing should feel like the natural next step after watching the video.

## Architecture Notes

### Frontend

* New primary section: `Studio`
* Studio replaces Labs entry point in UI
* Labs directory remains intact
* Preview-first UI: video is the main surface

### Backend / Services

* New service directory:

  ```
  /services/studio
  ```
* Focus on `regular` tier only

Studio service responsibilities:

* Question → script generation
* Scene segmentation
* Caption generation
* Video assembly orchestration
* Output format handling (vertical / horizontal)

---

## Editorial Video Template (Core Implementation)

This is the real Studio template. It is inspired by Vox-style editorial explainers and optimized for human, professional, and trustworthy delivery.

The system works in three layers:

1. What the user sees (final video)
2. Internal structure generated by the LLM
3. Remotion-based rendering template

---

## 1. What the User Sees (Final Video)

* Duration: 10–60 seconds
* Format:

  * Vertical 9:16 (mobile-first)
  * Horizontal 16:9 (desktop preview)

### Visual Style

* Real human presence in background (stock footage)
* Large, high-contrast text
* Fast pacing
* Feeling of "someone explaining it clearly to me"

### Example Question

"Why does inflation happen?"

### Mental Preview of Resulting Video

**Scene 1 (0–3s) – Hook**

* Human walking or gesturing
* Large text:
  "Why does inflation happen?"

**Scene 2 (3–15s) – Idea 1**

* Cut to different human shot
* Text:
  "It starts when demand grows faster than supply"

**Scene 3 (15–30s) – Idea 2**

* Calmer background
* Text:
  "More money chasing the same goods = higher prices"

**Scene 4 (30–45s) – Takeaway**

* Inspirational framing
* Text:
  "Inflation isn’t magic. It’s imbalance."

**Scene 5 (45–50s) – Outro**

* Subtle branding
* Text:
  "Explained by Curios"

---

## 2. Internal Structure Generated by the LLM

The LLM does not generate video directly. It generates a structured video plan that can be rendered deterministically.

Example output:

```json
{
  "duration": 50,
  "scenes": [
    {
      "from": 0,
      "to": 90,
      "text": "Why does inflation happen?",
      "style": "hook"
    },
    {
      "from": 90,
      "to": 270,
      "text": "It starts when demand grows faster than supply",
      "style": "explain"
    },
    {
      "from": 270,
      "to": 450,
      "text": "More money chasing the same goods = higher prices",
      "style": "explain"
    },
    {
      "from": 450,
      "to": 675,
      "text": "Inflation isn’t magic. It’s imbalance.",
      "style": "takeaway"
    }
  ]
}
```

Constraints:

* Plain language
* No academic tone
* Short sentences
* Optimized for spoken clarity

## 3. Remotion Rendering Template (Simplified)

### Video.tsx

```tsx
import { Composition } from 'remotion';
import { StudioVideo } from './StudioVideo';

export const RemotionRoot = () => {
  return (
    <Composition
      id="StudioVideo"
      component={StudioVideo}
      durationInFrames={1500} // 50s @ 30fps
      fps={30}
      width={1080}
      height={1920}
      defaultProps={{
        scenes: [],
        audioUrl: ''
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

---

### StudioVideo.tsx

```tsx
import { AbsoluteFill, Sequence } from 'remotion';

export const StudioVideo = ({ scenes, audioUrl }) => {
  return (
    <AbsoluteFill style={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}>

      {/* Background video */}
      <VideoBackground />

      {/* Scene text overlays */}
      {scenes.map((scene, index) => (
        <Sequence
          key={index}
          from={scene.from}
          durationInFrames={scene.to - scene.from}
        >
          <TextOverlay text={scene.text} style={scene.style} />
        </Sequence>
      ))}

      {/* Voiceover */}
      <Audio src={audioUrl} />
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

---

### TextOverlay.tsx

```tsx
export const TextOverlay = ({ text, style }) => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        bottom: '15%',
        width: '100%',
        textAlign: 'center',
        fontSize: style === 'hook' ? 90 : 64,
        fontWeight: 700,
        color: 'white',
        padding: '0 80px'
      }}
    >
      {text}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Animations (fade, slide, scale) are added using `interpolate()`.

## Key Insight

The competitive advantage is not video generation.

It is the structured system that reliably converts trustworthy knowledge into short, clear, shareable explanations.

This template already does that.
