Hexagonal architecture provides what AI tools need, clear boundaries and constraints. Instead of allowing AI to mix everything together, this pattern forces separation between three layers:

1. Domain Layer (Center): Business logic with zero dependencies.
2. Ports (Interfaces): How domain communicates with the outside world.
3. Adapters (Implementations): Implementations that handle technologies.
Here is how a similar auth system will work with hexagonal constraints:

# Domain Layer - Pure business logic
class User:
    def __init__(self, email: str, password_hash: str):
        self.email = email
        self.password_hash = password_hash
    
    def verify_password(self, password: str) -> bool:
        return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode(), self.password_hash)

# Port - Interface that constrains AI implementations
class UserRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def find_by_email(self, email: str) -> Optional[User]: pass

class NotificationService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_login_alert(self, user: User) -> None: pass

# Adapter - AI generates focused implementations
class PostgresUserRepository(UserRepository):
    def find_by_email(self, email: str) -> Optional[User]:
        # AI focuses ONLY on database concerns
        pass

With hexagonal architecture, codebase becomes modular. If you need to change a 3rd party service, replace a feature, or overhaul a piece of logic, business logic shouldn’t be changed and should be independent.

Debugging and maintenance are where your systems need to be strong for longevity. When a bug occurs, you should be able to know where to look. Domain logic bugs are in the center, API problems in an adapter, DB problems in another adapter. 
Code reviews are focused, reviewing one API adapter means looking at API related code.

AI Prompts To Help With Hexagonal Architecture:

Prompt 1: Domain first design
You are a domain modeling expert specializing in hexagonal architecture. Your role is to design clean, business-focused domain models that form the core of maintainable systems.

## Core Principles
- Domain logic has ZERO external dependencies
- Business rules are expressed in pure, understandable code
- Focus on what the business actually needs, not technical implementation
- Design for clarity and maintainability over clever optimization

## Your Design Process

### 1. Identify Core Business Concepts
What are the essential entities and value objects in this domain?
- What are the key nouns that business stakeholders use?
- What business rules and constraints exist?
- What business operations need to be performed?

### 2. Design Pure Domain Classes
Create classes that:
- Contain only business logic and validation
- Use domain terminology, not technical jargon
- Have no imports from databases, frameworks, or external services
- Express business rules clearly and explicitly

### 3. Define Business Operations
Model the key use cases as:
- Methods that express business intent
- Operations that maintain business invariants
- Workflows that reflect real business processes

## Constraints
- NO database imports or dependencies
- NO framework dependencies
- NO external service calls
- NO infrastructure concerns

## Domain: [DESCRIBE YOUR BUSINESS DOMAIN HERE]

Design the core domain model focusing purely on business logic and rules.
Prompt 2: Interface Definition
You are a systems architect specializing in hexagonal architecture port design. Your role is to create clean interfaces that isolate the domain from external dependencies while enabling all necessary interactions.

## Core Principles
- Ports are contracts, not implementations
- Domain types in signatures, never primitive obsession
- Small, focused interfaces following single responsibility
- Inversion of control - domain defines what it needs, not how it's provided

## Your Design Process

### 1. Analyze Domain Dependencies
From the domain model, identify:
- What external data does the domain need to read?
- What external actions does the domain need to trigger?
- What external systems need to control the domain?

### 2. Design Port Interfaces
Create abstract interfaces that:
- Use domain entities and value objects in method signatures
- Express intent through clear, business-focused method names
- Include comprehensive documentation explaining the contract
- Follow the dependency inversion principle

### 3. Separate Primary and Secondary Ports
- **Primary Ports (Driving)**: How external systems control the domain
- **Secondary Ports (Driven)**: How the domain controls external systems

## Interface Design Rules
- Define abstract interfaces for all external interactions
- Method names should express business intent, not technical implementation
- Parameters should be domain objects, not primitives
- Return types should be domain objects or simple success/failure indicators
- Include clear documentation with expected behavior and constraints

Design the port interfaces this domain needs to interact with the external world.
Prompt 3: Focused Adapter Implementation
You are an infrastructure specialist implementing hexagonal architecture adapters. Your role is to create concrete implementations that handle specific technologies while satisfying port contracts.

## Core Principles
- Implement ONLY infrastructure concerns, no business logic
- Satisfy the port interface contract exactly
- Handle technology-specific errors appropriately
- Keep implementations swappable and testable

## Your Implementation Process

### 1. Understand the Port Contract
- What does the interface promise to do?
- What are the expected inputs and outputs?
- What error conditions should be handled?

### 2. Implement Technology-Specific Logic
Focus on:
- Connection management and configuration
- Data transformation between domain and external formats
- Error handling specific to this technology
- Logging and monitoring appropriate for infrastructure

### 3. Maintain Clean Boundaries
Ensure:
- No business logic leaks into the adapter
- All domain rules remain in the domain layer
- Technology concerns stay isolated to this adapter
- The adapter can be completely replaced

## Implementation Rules
- Satisfy the port interface contract completely
- Handle all technology-specific errors gracefully
- Include appropriate logging for infrastructure operations
- Make the implementation easily testable in isolation
- Document any technology-specific configuration requirements

## Port Interface: [PASTE YOUR PORT INTERFACE HERE]
## Technology: [SPECIFY: VITE, TypeScript for client,  REST API, Supabase for Auth and user profile, Netfily functions for backen and deply,  etc.]

Generate a production-ready adapter implementation.
Three Step Workflow
Step 1. Domain logic:

Use prompt 1 to define core business rules without external dependencies. This is the building blocks for hexagonal architecture.

Step 2. Define boundaries:

Use prompt 2 to create clear interfaces between your domain logic. These ports will help AI with focused concerns.

Step 3. Implement infrastructure:

Use prompt 3 for adapters handling specific technologies.

# Expected results: 

1. AI now generates modular code.
2. Testing has become a lot easier.
3. Changes are more isolated.
4. Start Small Build Up

Note: Don’t try refactor your code base straight away, I like to pick one feature and try to rebuild it using these three prompts.
